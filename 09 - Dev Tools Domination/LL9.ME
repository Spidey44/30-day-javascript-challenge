<!-- practice: 
TIPS #1 visualize a change made when code running

In Google Chrome, right click on an element in the page and select "Inspect Element." 
The Developer Tools window or pane will open with that element selected in the source view. 
You can then right click the selected tag and choose "Break on Attributes Modifications."


TIPS #2 - testing an previous element
console.asset ( 1 === 1, element 2 will run if element 1 true)

TIPS #3 - Clear page
console.clear()

TIPS #4 - View element + method and properties related
console.log(p)
console.dir(p)
